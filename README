Project 5 CS5700: Roll Your Own CDN
Bach Nguyen - Thai Pham

1. High-Level Approach:
- Understand how CDN works with DNS and HTTP servers
- Implement server-client measurement
- Implement DNS
- Implement HTTP server
- Write scripts (draft)

2. DNS Implementation:
We use socketserver library to get request from client and dnslib library to unpack receiving packet
and pack sent-out packet

3. HTTP Server Implementation:
We use http.server library to create HTTP server, urllib library to get data from
origin server and are working on cache mechanism (thinking of sqlite3 library, which is allowed)

4. Measurement Implementation:
We are currently using geo-location measurement. Plan to research about scamper for improvement

5. Individual Contributions:
- Thai Pham:
